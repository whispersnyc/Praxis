 <br>Ideas: Distrust of authority, phobia of confined spaces (anxiety), lack of sociability (via seclusion; social anxiety), performance anxiety = &lt;100% success rate -&gt; mastery = &gt;100% speed, hyperawareness: insomnia/hallucinations/dissociation/memory fragmentations, survivors guilt, having not seeing water in ages a sip restores a bit of conscious away from feral animal,<br>
Inclusion of feminine coming-of-age struggles like Paper Girls?<br>
How man reacts to impulse define what type of man he is: like lightning redirecting through the body<br>Hideki: Should he have been alexithymic before spirit possession?<br>
False Avatar Yun descended into madness. How does this apply to Arthit/Hideki?<br>
Arthit is like Zaheer, very spiritually in tune but kills people. He is a white lotus in the making. Should Hideki/Sato be Red Lotus?<br>Breath control before launching an ultimate<br>
Yin yang like chi seperation minigame for lightning bending<br>
Since P'li can curve combustion and detonate early, San (yuyan) and Zarya (sun warrior, air-influenced) can get range/microadjustment/breath efficiency buffs in trade for power/curvability/early detonation<br>
Factors: range/microadjustment/breath efficiency/power/curvability/early detonation<br>Zarya's mother didn't adjust well with Air Nomad customs and left. They are medium progressive<br>
Could the sun warriors still be alive? Would they be too hidden to be found by Zarya's mom?<br>
How about Jeong Jeong's tribe?<br>
How would the White and Red Lotus organizations develop? (Black Grandmaster Lotus outfits for the White Lotus would be sick)<br>Sato: Voice sounds like Ultron's with the mask on, Varrick without? Would that be copying Varrick too much?<br>
Color purple like kuvira's spirit root canon blasts. Should the reactor be in the center/right of his chest (aka connected to lungs) or left of his chest (connected to the heart)?<br>
LED brightness should rise and lower with audible breath.<br>After a boss battle, zarya speedrun unlocks the last couple elements as her makeshift family falls apart (death, betrayal, forceful seperation, loss of will to fight) and finally kills her villain and becomes a somewhat realized Avatar but feels like shes left with nothing but a world of responsibility, a bittersweet victory.<br>Compare with Aang/Korra to triangulate: when they get their other elements, when the avatar state is activated for the first time, spirituality curve<br>Avatar's responsibility: correct previous Avatar's mistakes, serve as bridge between humans/spirits<br>
White Lotus: plays a multi-century patience game for the greater good (sometimes goes against the Avatar) -&gt; supports the Avatar to save the world -&gt; protects the Avatar from the Red Lotus<br>
Red Lotus: capture the Avatar to end the cycle<br>Follow the Avatar Tai prewrite trajectory<br>Beast of Spirit Temple contains memories about the Sun Warriors, from Hanami or an actual Sun Warrior-origin Avatar?<br>
Sun warriors in the spirit world make sense because dragons are spirit world animals, especially in an even grander dragon temple. (sky bison present in spirit world?)<br>
Sandbender: Carry a gourd like Gaara?<br>
Age of kidnapping should be after he learns about the bees and knees so the "ending" hits harder<br>Painted Lady? Yue inclusion (intended to be the avatar)?<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/15oul5m/are_there_dust_storms_at_night/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/BurningMan/comments/15oul5m/are_there_dust_storms_at_night/</a>]]></description><link>projects\avatar\scratchpad.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Projects/Avatar/Scratchpad.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 10:07:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Avatar Shunen]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Style: Sifu<br>
Movement/Combat: For Honor<br>
Engine: Godot 4<br>This project was born for three reasons:<br>
<br>Easter Egg: Combustion-bending tattoos would glow in the Avatar state like Air Master tattoos because its on a chi path (presumably the Third Eye chakra, inspired by Hindu God Shiva's symbol)
<br>Unique Combat: I doubt Avatar Studios will create a game with the radically different combat system and tailored control scheme that the bending arts deserve
<br>ATLA's Vision: The original show established a mythical awe in the Avatar State, bending philosophy and rich cultural diversity. Let's bring that back.
<br><br><br><br><br>The music in Avatar is incredible, unique and a foundational part of why the shows are so good. Here's some reference music albums/mixes related to Avatar's tone/origins and their respective contexts. I recommend putting one on while reading this to set the mood.<br><a class="auto-card-link-card" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIVfOCd04BA"><div class="auto-card-link-main"><div class="auto-card-link-title"></div><div class="auto-card-link-description"></div><div class="auto-card-link-host"><span></span></div></div></a>[Ambience] Yingying - Chinese Guqin relaxing classical musicThe Chinese guqin is a plucked seven-string instrument of the zither family, sometimes referred to as "the instrument of the sages" associated with refinement, literati and sometimes with the philosopher, Confucius.www.youtube.com<img class="auto-card-link-thumbnail" src="https://i.postimg.cc/23RWPzwM/guqin-album-art.png" draggable="false"><br><a class="auto-card-link-card" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDLDqh0Xpew"><div class="auto-card-link-main"><div class="auto-card-link-title"></div><div class="auto-card-link-description"></div><div class="auto-card-link-host"><span></span></div></div></a>[Tension] Java - Gamelans From The Sultan's Palace In JogjakartaGamelan is the traditional ensemble music of the Javanese, Sundanese, and Balinese peoples of Indonesia, made up predominantly of percussive instruments: metallophones played by mallets and a set of hand-played drums called kendhang which register the beat.www.youtube.com<img class="auto-card-link-thumbnail" src="https://i.postimg.cc/TwsgJjWR/gamelans-album-art.jpg" draggable="false"><br><a class="auto-card-link-card" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1Yjmbc6768"><div class="auto-card-link-main"><div class="auto-card-link-title"></div><div class="auto-card-link-description"></div><div class="auto-card-link-host"><span></span></div></div></a>[Battle] Joffre Videz - Taiko DeliriumTaiko or wadaiko indicate a variety of Eastern percussion intruments such as nagadō-daiko (large barrel-shaped), and others like the shime-daiko (smaller).

 <br>This is a rough copy-and-paste of relevant discussion with the White Lotus chat (thanks uriel and nastune, yall are the best)<br>Because fire nation tends to give parts of their name to the kid so if let’s say her name was Yangchen for example the name could be Yangzu of Ryuchen for example<br>Fire Nation characters have given names and clan names. They do not usually mention their clan names when they introduce themselves unless it is relevant to the situation or they are trying to show off for some reason. Families in the Fire Nation often like to pass individual syllables in their names on to one another: a woman named Zaagar might pass one character in her name on to her child or nibling, naming them Daozaa or Garrun. Use one or two syllables below for each given name and clan name. Zaagar breaks down to Zaa and Gar Garrun takes the gar part of her name Daozaa takes the zaa part of her name<br>Given this story takes place in the future they may not do clan names anymore<br>- uriel<br><br>we can also look to tibetan names (gyatso, tenzin, kelsang, jetsun, pema, pasang, tashi) - me<br><br>Google translate isn't very good.<br>
<br>For Chinese, I recommend using this (<a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" title="https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php" href="https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php" target="_blank">https://chinese.yabla.com/chinese-english-pinyin-dictionary.php</a>) and wiktionary.
<br>For Japanese, <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" title="https://www.romajidesu.com/" href="https://www.romajidesu.com/" target="_blank">https://www.romajidesu.com/</a> and wiktionary.
<br>For Korean, wiktionary and there was a handful of useful wikipedia pages
<br>For Tibetan, there are many resources and many people you can take names from. For checking the meaning and the spelling, use <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" title="https://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page" href="https://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">https://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/Main_Page</a> (it has the Buddhist Masters link with many names in categories. Be prepared for strange direct romanizations, though)
<br>For Inuit (Water Tribe names), a variety of sources but try to verify them in some dictionaries
<br>For Mongolian (mostly FN names), bolor toli dictionary <img alt="✨" src="https://discord.com/assets/5df680186a4bdc43d2cc.svg" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> 
<br>General:<br>
<br>wiktionary is your friend
<br>behindthename is a really good one, but double-check if something isn't verified enough
<br>most babynames websites are pretty sketchy, but not 100%. So it's okay to use them foe ideas, but you have to double check things
<br>- nastune<br><br>
btw i saw an airbender character in the wiki 'Malu' which is 'indonesian/malay' for shyness and polynesian for 'gentle/calm wind' - me
<br>
<br>Indonesian - yes, there are some, but can't confirm any Polynesian languages for Avatar world. There are a couple of Hawaiian names, but not commonly. I think those were either for Hira'a village and for non-standard WT people (like pirates or those with URN nationality)
<br>Check out the Names in the World of Avatar page on the avatar wiki, it has a lot of stuff (these pages above helped expand this article, too). Also, there are useful name lists in the RPG core book
<br>- nastune<br><br>Oww they overhauled the useful format of the wikipedia article on Korean names<br>
Anyway, here's the version I found useful:<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Korean_given_names&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1236149527" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Korean_given_names&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1236149527" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Korean_given_names&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1236149527</a><br>More:<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Korean_given_names" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Korean_given_names" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Korean_given_names</a> (atla sometimes uses non-standard romanization)<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Personal_names" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Personal_names" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Personal_names</a> (East Asian cat., Mongolian, Tibetan, Hawaiian (in special circumstances), and Indosphere cat. are your friends)<br>- nastune<br><br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://atlaculture.tumblr.com/post/715439644484993024/correction-for-an-old-post-vachir-isnt" target="_blank">https://atlaculture.tumblr.com/post/715439644484993024/correction-for-an-old-post-vachir-isnt</a><br>

Toph Beifong: chinese for expanding lotus, northern<br>
Kyoshi: japanese for samurai of the capital<br>
Suki: japanese for beloved (unconfirmed)<br>
Kuvira: chinese for security team<br>
Bumi: sanskrit for earth/land<br>
Opal: word originates from sanskrit for jewel<br>
Suyin: chinese for unadorned sound = plain sound/simple tone interpreted as beauty in simplicity<br>
Haru: japanese for spring (dominant season for earthbenders, mention of seasons affecting bending in The Last Airbender: Legacy)<br>

Coincidentally, Jinora is also a well-read girl, having encyclopedic knowledge on various subjects, such as being able to identify a fire ferret on the spot and recite its natural habitat.<br>Ikki is a Japanese male name with a few different meanings, though the most appropriate would be "radiance, shine, sparkle"; the literal meaning of the word is "riot, insurrection". Both translations attribute to Ikki's hyperactive tendencies.<br>
<br>Ikki is also short for Tuulikki, a girl's name that means "little wind" in Finnish, in line with her being an airbender.
<br>Ikki also means "two" in various Turkic languages, which is in line with her being a second-born child.
<br>Pema (Tibetan: པདྨ།, Wylie: padma, English: "Lotus") shares her name with various important Tibetan and Bhutanese Buddhist figures, including:<br>
<br>The American-born Tibetan Buddhist nun, author, and teacher Pema Chödrön.
<br>Gedun Drupa, who was posthumously recognized as the first Dalai Lama, whose birth name was Pema Dorje.
<br>The sister of the 14th and current Dalai Lama, Jetsun Pema.
<br>The current Druk Gyaltsuen (wife of the Druk Gyalpo of the Kingdom of Bhutan), also named Jetsun Pema.

So here’s my pitch for “The Next Avatar.”<img class="auto-card-link-thumbnail" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oLMwSpeErKw/maxresdefault.jpg" draggable="false"><br>The following is essentially a summary/rewrite of the contents of this video, with the writer's commentary mixed with mine in the <a class="internal-link" data-href="#Commentary" href="about:blank#Commentary" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Commentary</a> section below. I'd recommend either watching this video then reading the commentary or just read this full page.<br>Premise: Ninety years after the events of Legend of Korra, the world faces a new threat from within the Earth Kingdom. Earth King Wu's attempts at establishing democracy was flawed and failed. Despite Kuvira's defeat, her ideals of strength and control resonate with many, leading to the rise of a new Earth King who exploits these fears and radicalization of lots of the civilians. Knowing Korra stood in his way and anticipating the next Avatar will be an Earthbender, he waited for her peaceful death before enacting his plan. This plan involves expanding Ba Sing Se's walls, reinstating the Dai Li with absolute control, and conscripting Earthbender children into a brainwashed military force. Republic City is now treated as Aang's undermining of Earth Kingdom authority. The other nations, fearing another war, remain complacent, hoping the next Avatar will intervene.<br>The Earth Empire's Rise: This new Earth Kingdom, effectively Kuvira's Empire all over again, exiles people from surrounding nations and imprisons/brainwashes dissenting civilians, benders and non-benders alike. Republic City, once a symbol of innovation and diversity, is conquered under the guise of protection. The Earth King deliberately avoids searching for the new Avatar, hoping to prevent interference.<br>Tai's Introduction: Tai, a sixteen-year-old Dai Li trainee raised in Ba Sing Se, is raised on the Earth Kingdom's propaganda, never having been outside city walls. He's never seen battle yet trains daily as a child soldier to defend the greatest country. The Dai Li's job is to ensure greatness and serves as the bedrock of their nation. He is fun, easy-going and free-spirited like Aang, the opposite of his element like Korra was. He and his older brother-like friend, Kenshi, encounter Dai Li bullies robbing a Cabbage Man. These three have been harassing Tai all his life. While chasing one down, Tai accidentally separates from Kenshi and once the other bullies catch up and outnumber him, he accidentally firebends while fighting in desperation, revealing his identity as the Avatar.<br>The Weaponized Avatar: Earth Kingdom officials are immediately notified and they work to exploit Tai's power, attempting to weaponize the Avatar. Iroh taught us how each nation embodies different fundamental ideals. Understanding them helps understand the world and one's self holistically. Thus, while lacking diverse bending masters and due to modern Ba Sing Se's echo chamber nature, Tai's firebending is underdeveloped at his best, let alone attempting water or airbending. However, through months of experimentation and brainwashing, they can now successfully activate the Avatar State on command, turning Tai into an instrument of destruction. As a thoroughly-indoctrinated loyal Earth Kingdom soldier, he consents to being used this way but mainly because he has no recollection of his actions during the blackouts. He believes the Earth King's will is his purpose as the Avatar. In contrast to a messiah-type figure who brings balance to the world, the Avatar is now a symbol of fear and death.<br>Korra's Intervention: One night, Tai encounters a shadowed figure. He calls out but the man, without response, spreads his arms and turns the surrounding ground to lava. Tai exhausts his skills defensively fighting the man until Tai's eyes start to glow. "Korra, it really is you," the man says, now revealed as Bolin. Temporarily replaced by Korra's spirit,  Tai replies, "Good to see you again, Bolin." Bolin shows Tai the suffering his actions have caused while under the Earth King's control. This revelation mirrors Iroh and Zuko's respective journeys of guilt and redemption, posing the question of how an Avatar grapples with such responsibility. Due to the experimentation and brainwashing, Tai doesn't have control over the Avatar State but his attunement to Raava and the Spirit World allows easier communication with Korra, without needing to enter the Spirit World or to meditate. She is able to observe and communicate with Tai as well as show herself on special occasions. We see how much she's matured while serving as a guiding hand to Tai, a somewhat active participant from now on.<br>Escape from Ba Sing Se: Bolin, now much older and part of the New Freedom Fighters movement (along with Jinora, Asami and/or Mako), has been secretly searching for the Avatar in Ba Sing Se. He's lost a lot of his humor and personality after witnessing so many horrors but seeing Korra again brought back some of his life. He smuggles Tai outside the Ba Sing Se walls to see innocent people dead or in cages, oppressed by those supposedly keeping them safe. He even witnesses the aftermath of raw power from an impossible force: himself. Seeing and accepting the truth through lifelong indoctrination can be a long and slow process sometimes but tragedy has a way of instantly clearing the fog. Either way, the result is the same and so is the one path to redemption and overcoming his newfound guilt. Bolin reveals a hidden young sky bison to help Tai escape to a firebending master. Tai confronts Kenshi about everything, who's silence admits to knowing the truth and he begins to defend the Earth Kingdom's actions. Kenshi refuses to leave because the Earth King put in an order for something big: a massive, full-scale expansion to grow their home and share it with the rest of the world... starting with the Southern Water Tribe. Tai fully understands what this is: an invasion. Another hundred-year war. Heartbroken by his friend's betrayal, Tai attempts to escape, leading to a fight with Kenshi in which he's fighting defensively and nearly captured. Bolin intervenes, allowing Tai to flee on the bison while he watches Bolin get beaten and arrested.<br>The Journey Begins: Tai, now alone with the guidance of Korra's spirit, begins his journey to right the Earth Kingdom's wrongs and rebuild the Avatar's reputation, witnessing destruction firsthand and fights driven by guilt and a sense of justice to help people. He aims to reconnect with his past lives, starting with Aang, whose fractured spirit resides in the spirit world in his child form with fragmented memories due to the severed connection. As Tai meditates at Aang's important places (southern air temple, where zuko saved him as the blue spirit, ruins of republic city where he proposed to katara, where tenzin first learned airbending, where he buried appa?) and revisits relevant characters (ko the face stealer, heibai, painted lady, yue, maybe iroh), Aang ages up visibly each time as flashbacks restore his memories. He is forced to accept that his efforts in stopping the Fire Nation and bringing balance wasn't permanent; the rise of fascism and the cycle of violence are constants that need to be actively observed and countered ahead of time. <br>The Rest of the Series:  The show explores themes of historical repetition, fascism's enduring nature, and the dangers of complacency. The series will follow Tai's travels, similarly guided by and restoring connections with past Avatar spirits, to master the elements and confront the Earth Kingdom's regime. A major tactic of fascism is eliminating history, hence the focus on reconnecting with past lives and staying in contact with history. Kenshi, blamed for Tai's escape thus now tasked with hunting him, teases a potential redemption arc during a tragic descent into unwavering loyalty, like She-Ra's sisters turned bitter enemies. Tai may eventually have to accept that not everyone can change. Tai will challenge the leaders of the other nations for their inaction, as it now exacerbated the problem to this level. You cant wait till violence affects you personally to care because by that point, it'll be too late.<br><br>This fanon is interesting because it can be applied to both the Earth and Fire Avatars following Korra. For example, I doubt the canon Earth Avatar will be born as Dai Li but the themes of indoctrination and weaponization apply heavily to combustion-benders. It explores the common question, what if the Avatar was born on the wrong side? The young Avatars and Dai Li/Unanimity companions will be brainwashed into sleeper agents and their Avatar states taken under control. Whether their philosophies will echo their oppressors is more likely as a soldier than a convict and dependent on how well the different propaganda they're fed aligns with their personal experiences.<br>Avatar has always been political. The first movie is very anti-fascist and all the villains in Korra represent a different ideology. Since the canon Earth Avatars are gonna be young children, there's a chance they'll take the totalitarian regime route again like Ozai, Kuvira and this new Earth King<br>The overall concept of this story is very similar to ATLA's Hundred-Year War and Kuvira's Earth Empire. Thought we should embrace change like Korra instead of attempting to be a carbon copy of the OG Avatar, this case is by design since the theme is "history repeats itself". The use of a sky bison, or a similar hybrid companion, is considered for branding and practicality for the writer (a "home base" and traveling loop is useful for the episodic format).<br>He intentionally avoids recreating the original "Gaang" dynamic even though it was one of the keys of the OG show's success, focusing on Tai's solitary journey as one way to set this Avatar adventure different. Also, he wants to include familiar elements and characters but avoid excessive fan service so the New Freedom Fighter inclusions and the character revisit selections for Aang's memories should be meticulous.<br>I agree with the Earth Avatar's overarching challenge being to correct Korra's mistakes: re-establish connections with the past Avatars and address the conflicts regarding the new spirit portal. Similarly, we have to speculate which mistakes this/any Earth avatar would make and set that as the Fire Avatar's main goal to correct.<br>I think it's unrealistic for the Earth King to let the Avatar go undiscovered, regardless of "neutral jing" philosophy, because this is an ineffective way to minimize the Avatar's inevitable interference. In a controlling regime, the expected course of action in my opinion would be to find and weaponize the next Avatar thus: have a surveillance network that would notify one's rise, have a foolproof abduction method always ready and actively use all Avatar seeking methods to locate them. The last and most important one isn't being employed by the writer.]]></description><link>projects\avatar\references\avatar-tai.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Projects/Avatar/References/Avatar Tai.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:12:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\avatar-tai-solo.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="lib\media\avatar-tai-solo.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Story]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br><br><img alt="style ref" src="lib\media\style-ref.jpeg"><br>(WIP: add new prelude lore during Earth avatar generation)<br>(WIP: MC's parents lore, upbringing before/during Unanimity)<br>Lore above will appear to the viewer later in the story via character dialogue, environment design or PTSD flashback imagery.<br><br><br><img class="avatar svelte-okpkt8" alt="Avatar" src="lib\media\shunen.jpg">   Shunen is a combustion bender who was captured at a young age from his Air Nomad mother and survived the Unanimity trials until he escaped at 16.  He regularly risked exploring the facility, against the threat of solitary confinement, electrocution and/or "reprogramming." He is nimble, empathetic, resilient and hyper-vigilant. He used his prodigious firebending, with an affinity for speed, to defend helpless inmates. <br><br><br><img class="avatar svelte-okpkt8" alt="Avatar" src="lib\media\monzart_airbender.jpg">   Zayah is Shunen's mother. She was incredibly spritually-attuned able to spiritually project and enter the Spirit World (a Spirit Library scholar). That was before Shunen was concieved with a firebending father who left when things went downhill: her bending became weaker, her health/self-love declined and she lost her spiritual abilities. Despite it all, she was always an incredibly loving and caring mother, sister and helper. After Shunen's capture, she fell apart and started using fans to maintain her dying bending. <br><br>(WIP: break out on episode 2, spend time showing the injustice of the camp before ramping up)<br>MC begins in a combustion bending camp off the record from any government authorities, thus technologically outdated. Owners unknown and the workers appear to be non-benders armed with Equalist-style tech. His mother taught him effective breathing techniques for meditation which is the only reason little Shunen got this far.<br><br><br><img class="avatar svelte-okpkt8" alt="Avatar" src="lib\media\yuyan-combustion-icon.png">   Jin is a stoic yuyan archer captured for Unanimity who maintains his vow of silence throughout. He begins as a weak victimized character with a starved medium-tall stature during his appearance in Unanimity, no tattoo. He reappears in the future as a full-on Unanimity mercenary who completed his training and is loyal enough to his 'contractors' to one day encounter Shunen again as an opponent until they recognize each other. <br>MC has a big brother figure due to their friendly history but he's a complete asshole these days that regularly switches up abruptly. We observe the pain this causes MC who always tries to trust him and has love for him. MC is constantly defending the people who get picked on and thus gets targetted too but no one defends him. He's been punished many times for fighting and for trespassing by electric shock, solitary confinement, "reprogramming" or anything the guard thought would be funny. He's done some airbending and earthbending subtly like breaking a chunk of stone off that held his binding chain underwater or exhaled supernaturally hard and blown someone far away off their footing while strapped to a chair but nothing irrefutably Avatar-like.<br>That's until they took it too far with brutally and unfairly punishing him and Ajna, the go-to victim for extreme bullying. The bigger inmates are always willing to dish out freshly burnt limbs on a whim, scars under handwraps and clothes to prove it. Having recently become 16, Ajna goes into the Avatar State for the first time and leaves the camp torn apart with knocked out bodies lining the floor (only bullies and guards, no one killed) before busting out. (edit: add details)<br><br>MC wakes up dehydrated and horribly sunburnt somewhere in the Si Wong Desert, dumbfounded of how he got here having forgotten the Avatar state situation entirely. He starts walking towards dig site for shelter as it starts getting dark. Unbeknownst to him, this is the Wan Shi Ton library excavation site (commissioned by Jarvis Sato) but the library is now in the Spirit World and thus the project was abandoned. Once he gets there, he sees sandbenders whom he shoots a fireball above them to get their attention, then shoots upwards in a pattern to indicate location.<br><br><br><img class="avatar svelte-okpkt8" alt="Avatar" src="lib\media\sora-icon.png">   Gaden is an Air Nomad pretending to be a Sandbender, imitating the earth sub-bending forms well. His specialty is blinding/suffocating, used to avoid direct combat. He practices his Air Nomad customs helping however he can while incognito.
(WIP: add details) <br><br><br><img class="avatar svelte-okpkt8" alt="Avatar" src="lib\media\kaliph-icon.png">   The Kaliph is teated like a spiritual leader in the Si Wong settlement. His specialty is mudbending which he uses like Kuvira/Dai Lee. He has an unusually large body and a wheezy, harsh voice that he uses very sparingly due to a burn injury on the throat and upper body. Adorned in jewelry and wrapped like a mummy, his status was earned by helping build the settlement from the ground up and resolving conflicts with a heavy hand. He carries a sword and gourd of mud. <br>Tashi is the disrespected young guy of the sandbenders who's always doing the labor of powering the sand-sailer. He asks everyone to split their portion of water since everyone is running low but they force him to give MC his whole portion. They mock him for acting air nomad like, joking about what they'd do if they "get [their] hands on one of those Nomad girls" out of earshot of the boss and asks MC for trade for ride to their settlement. He has nothing so he offers labor (to boost the sailer from behind with firebending (goes to the back of the sailer, grabs the edge and demonstrates with a light fire blast) but leader uses Kuvira/Dai Lee-style technique to bind his hands with rings (first flashback, Kuvira binding Korra) made from quickly ejected mud from his gourd and hardened. He raises MC's arms overhead and says 'winds' holding his other hand out then says 'burn' while pointing at the wooden deck then says 'trade'.<br>MC gives them his prison clothes. They all laugh but the leader who accepts and they start mounting the vehicle but they see the fin of a sand shark fast approaching, to which they start rushing to head to town. (edit: add details to fight) During the fight, Tashi is forced to protect the sailer with airbending. Leader sees this and Tashi looks at him worried but now freely able to use his airbending, they working together, they manage to escape.<br>
After fight, leader calls Tashi a 'liar' and everyone braces to kill him. MC interrupts them while holding large amount of fire over their sailer and says 'trade'.<br>They get kicked off the sailer and are forced to walk to town, Tashi requiring assistance from dehydration. They discuss backstories, Tashi came here on a nomadic mission to help the town but since they dislike outsiders, he kept his airbending cloaked. MC keeps it general wondering if he still remembers his moms face and voice and if/how much she's changed. He's also just bewildered by how he got here, thinking about how drastically his life changed from just yesterday.<br><br><img alt="si wong desert" src="lib\media\si-wong-desert.jpg"><br>Tashi says they can speak to the kaliph if they have something to offer so he thinks of trading his airbending sailer, which he digs out from it's hiding spot, for a small transport vehicle to outside the desert. Tashi's done his time here, he believes. MC wants to find his mom so he wants to get to the closest woman's air temple. Once they arrive in town, people there are a bit nicer, lots of talk about the kaliph being a fair/honest man worldbuilding but unwelcoming to newcomers.<br>MC helps town somehow with firebending? (edit: add details, people's negative reaction turn positive?). They give him some clothes to wear. This news inevitably gets to the kaliph. Tashi and MC goes to sleep in his pathetic DIY tent after splitting the small amount of vegetarian foods Tashi collected. MC wakes up during sandstorm, most of which was shielded by the houses surrounding them. Tashi's still asleep and he goes back to sleep after the storm dies down.<br>Next day, they await the kaliph's audience for hours as people go in and out of the grand stone building until they're called. They bring the staff in as an offering, speaking of its emotional significance, and bows his head. He says "rise". They realize who it is from the voice so they look up and we see him unwrapped: burns all over exposed neck area, stitching on throat. He stays silent then points at MC "you helped". He gestures to a helper who takes the staff and the kaliph says "small" before they leave. Leads them to an isolated small diseased elephant-camel with a fucked up face and smells nauseating.<br>They're given just enough water and they set off that night, the water container and shelter supplies mounted on the creature. MC's unanimity/airbender breath training paid off as he doesn't get that exhausted while walking the long distances while controlling his breathing. They take turns riding it whom they named Cocoa for its abnormal chocolatey color. He uses breath of fire to warm them up citing his moms teaching about true firebending, though he usually just uses raw resolve to fuel his bending. Cocoa drains cactus juice with tusk and Tashi makes a joke about not drinking that, then he picks out the spikes and helps the little animal eat it. He explains to MC that elephant-camels can usually eat these without help. All three vegetarians share the cactus, disgusting/disorienting but filling.<br>Eventually they set up camp. This time, they both wake up as they get the full fury of a sandstorm which destroys their shelter. They sleep out in the open in the scorching heat. (edit: other encounters in the desert that justifies why everyone doesn't just leave) They travel like this for days and days.<br>Once they get to the nearest haven, they find that the newcomer/homeless system is pretty good because the previous avatar's street urchin upbringing lead them to focus on building out accommodations for the less fortunate. Cocoa is brought to healers and they are mostly able to heal him but they had to remove an eye. Tashi jokes about how they should've named him Zuko but "the scar is on the wrong side" but MC doesn't know who that is.<br><br>(WIP: They make their way to the Western (?) Air Temple; This should be full of people from all walks of life and different in other ways due to Haven system)<br><br><br><img class="avatar svelte-okpkt8" alt="Avatar" src="lib\media\nymia-icon.png">   Samaya is passionate about dancing, arts and cooking great vegetarian food. She is a soft-spoken respectful yet confident and talkative girl with a playful teasing nature who's found peace from within herself and from nature, a stark contrast from MC but he warms up quickly and indulges the banter (she's the big sister he never had). She is often found enjoying views alone while holding various impressive acrobatic poses effortlessly or hanging out with Mei Lin. She obtained her mastery tattoos at 19. <br><br><br><img class="avatar svelte-okpkt8" alt="Avatar" src="lib\media\air-acolyte.webp">   Mei Lin visited the Western Air Temple just because the Nomad visitors in her town were "so pretty and nice" and though she didn't really take to all the customs (quite materialistic and cares too much about her appearance), she decided to stay and everyone loves her joyous energy tempered with charisma and elegance. She especially enjoys Samaya's company. She is an Earth-born non-bender Air Acolyte who loves yoga and gardening but hates meditating. <br><br><br><br><img class="avatar svelte-okpkt8" alt="Avatar" src="lib\media\red-spirit.jpg">   Inspired by the Blue Spirit of legend who saved the Air Avatar past, the Red Spirit alter ego was born. With her Kusarigama, she can crowd control with intimidation and unpredictability. She can use the chain side as a whip to shatter bones (gunshot sound) or tangle it around sword hilts and legs if a weight or mini-hook is attached. She accrues a Robin Hood-like reputation in her area with a heavy bounty on her head. <br><br><br><img class="avatar svelte-okpkt8" alt="Avatar" src="lib\media\jarvis-sato-icon.png">   A spiritual successor to Amon, Jarvis Sato masterminds a brand new Equalist movement with his Future Industries CTO money. He obtained a spirit world equivalent of Jennamite which he surgically bound to his chest and it lightly burrowed through his body forming a symbiotic relationship, most of the initial growth surgically removed. As long as his tech keeps it stabilized, his energy-hungry suit can channel it's power. ]]></description><link>projects\avatar\elements\story.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Projects/Avatar/Elements/Story.md</guid><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 10:05:19 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\style-ref.jpeg" length="0" type="image/jpeg"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="lib\media\style-ref.jpeg"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Music]]></title><description><![CDATA[

At this point, even bigger studios are dropping games and trailers that use reskinned existing UE movement engines. Its eye-catching and looks impressive with very little work or creativity.<br>This also appeals to lots of naive gamers with a very generic idea of what an "objectively good game" looks like and plays like, which is 30+ hours of story/resource grind with a flashy light/heavy combo combat system and expansive skill tree (check <a class="internal-link" data-href="Gameplay" href="Gameplay" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Gameplay</a>). This is a safe bet for AAA studios that can dump a set huge amount of money, just pump out assets and people will eat it up for $60.<br>As <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZlx5vU4tSo" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZlx5vU4tSo" target="_blank">Drew Gooden</a> claims about the adaptation, Netflix chose spectacle over storytelling in their live-action. I don't like this overall trend of applying the new-gen formula to animated masterpieces like they're doing with Disney classics and anime. Even modern remasters of video games that remain stylized (ex. Ocarina of Time/Persona 3) lose the mood and color tones that make the games special, in my opinion. It's very clear we lose the soul during this process in trade for fidelity.<br><br><a class="auto-card-link-card" href="https://github.com/RPicster/godot4-demo-desert-light"><div class="auto-card-link-main"><div class="auto-card-link-title"></div><div class="auto-card-link-description"></div><div class="auto-card-link-host"><span></span></div></div></a>GitHub - RPicster/godot4-demo-desert-light: A graphics demo for Godot 4 - Focus is Volumetric Fog and Indirect IlluminationA graphics demo for Godot 4 - Focus is Volumetric Fog and Indirect Illumination - RPicster/godot4-demo-desert-lightgithub.com<img class="auto-card-link-thumbnail" src="https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/643621533/e0b049fa-4983-4184-b1e6-7c920f7dddc6" draggable="false"><br><a class="auto-card-link-card" href="https://www.deviantart.com/k-keii/art/MMD-Princess-Azula-Download-884151175"><div class="auto-card-link-main"><div class="auto-card-link-title"></div><div class="auto-card-link-host"><span></span></div></div></a>MMD Princess Azula Download by k-keii on DeviantArtwww.deviantart.com<img class="auto-card-link-thumbnail" src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/3bacb19c-7e13-4fb6-8af6-36163689b7c0/dg1kx65-d58f7d15-6a7f-42da-aa2d-a752c346f091.png/v1/fill/w_1060,h_754,q_70,strp/zuko_and_azula_by_k_keii_dg1kx65-pre.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9MjcyOSIsInBhdGgiOiJcL2ZcLzNiYWNiMTljLTdlMTMtNGZiNi04YWY2LTM2MTYzNjg5YjdjMFwvZGcxa3g2NS1kNThmN2QxNS02YTdmLTQyZGEtYWEyZC1hNzUyYzM0NmYwOTEucG5nIiwid2lkdGgiOiI8PTM4NDAifV1dLCJhdWQiOlsidXJuOnNlcnZpY2U6aW1hZ2Uub3BlcmF0aW9ucyJdfQ.mJ8CVdh1v3RRZfFTnVY37ApK2-Qq7CvzKpT55Y-ehpY" draggable="false"><br><a class="auto-card-link-card" href="https://godotshaders.com/shader/flexible-toon-shader-godot-4/"><div class="auto-card-link-main"><div class="auto-card-link-title"></div><div class="auto-card-link-description"></div><div class="auto-card-link-host"><span></span></div></div></a>Flexible Toon Shader (Godot 4) - Godot ShadersOriginal shader by CaptainProton42 ported to Godot 4 &nbsp; 🤸Flexibility...godotshaders.com<img class="auto-card-link-thumbnail" src="http://godotshaders.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/screenshot-3.png" draggable="false"><br><a class="auto-card-link-card" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_gF2nddVU"><div class="auto-card-link-main"><div class="auto-card-link-title"></div><div class="auto-card-link-description"></div><div class="auto-card-link-host"><span></span></div></div></a>Avatar: ICE WARS™ AAA RPG (PS5) OFFICIAL UPDATE!

 <br>
<br>1,000 True Fans Concept:

<br>Creator needs 1,000 true fans to make a living.
<br>True fan: buys anything you produce, drives long distances, purchases multiple versions, attends events.
<br>Aim for direct connection with 1,000 true fans instead of stardom.

<br>Direct relationship is key: fans pay you directly.


<br>Goal: earn $100 profit/year from each true fan.

<br>1,000 fans x $100/fan = $100,000/year.
<br>1,000 is a feasible number compared to millions.
<br>Adjust number based on earnings per fan, living expenses, team size.
<br>Aim for one day's wages per year from each fan.


<br>Regular fans exist around true fans, expanding income.
<br>True fans are marketing force for regular fans.


<br>New Technology Enables True Fan Model:

<br>Peer-to-peer communication allows direct sales.
<br>Creator keeps full payment, reducing needed fan count.
<br>Obscure content is one click away from popular content.
<br>Long Tail: Total sales of obscure items equal or exceed bestsellers.
<br>Aggregators channel attention to rare creations.
<br>Anything can interest at least one person in a million; find those fans.
<br>Corporations are ill-suited for niche audiences.


<br>Crowdfunding:

<br>Fans finance your next product.
<br>2,000 crowdfunding platforms worldwide.
<br>Kickstarter: largest crowdfunder, $2.5 billion raised, 241 funders average.
<br>True fans will become Kickstarter funders.


<br>Cultivating True Fans:

<br>Time-consuming, requires ongoing skills.
<br>Hire someone to deal with fans if needed.
<br>Use direct relations with super fans in addition to intermediaries.


<br>Original 2008 Essay Highlights:

<br>Long tail is mixed blessing for creators, massive competition.
<br>Convert Lesser Fans into True Fans.
<br>Maintain direct contact with True Fans.
<br>Technologies enable small-time manufacturing.
<br>Young artists have another path other than stardom, a path made possible by the very technology that creates the long tail.
<br>Linear increase in fans needed for creative groups.
<br>Direct fans are best, indirect requires more fans.
<br>Actual number of fans varies depending on media.


<br>Related concepts:

<br>Microcelebrities: famous to 1,500 people.
<br>Micro-patronage, distributed patronage.
<br>Street Performer Protocol: author goes directly to readers before publishing.
<br>Jill Sobule: used fans to finance recording fees.


<br>Caveats:

<br>Not every artist is willing to nurture fans.
<br>Poverty is the usual alternative.

 <br><br>C1: The Surprising Power of Tiny Habits<br>
Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits.<br>
Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits.<br>
Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you repeat.<br>
You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.<br>C2: How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)<br>
There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.<br>
Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.<br>
The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.<br>
Ask yourself, Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?<br>C3: How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps<br>
(1) make it obvious (2) make it attractive (3) make it easy (4) make it satisfying<br>
The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible.<br>
Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.<br><br>C4: The Man Who Didnt Look Right<br>
To rate a particular habit, ask yourself: Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?<br>
The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.<br>
(1.1) Habits Scorecard - start by making a list of your daily habits (and mark each +/-/= for positive/negative/neutral habit)<br>C5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit<br>
(1.2) Implementation intention - pair a new habit with a specific time and location. "I will (BEHAVIOR) at (TIME) in (LOCATION)."<br>
(1.3) Habit stacking - identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. "After (CURRENT HABIT), I will (NEW HABIT)."<br>C6: Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More<br>
Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.<br>
(1.4) Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.<br>C7: The Secret to Self-Control<br>
Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one (thus unreliable).<br>
(1.5) Make it invisible. Reduce exposure to the cue that causes the bad habit (remove it from your environment).<br><br>C8: How to Make a Habit Irresistible<br>
It is the anticipation of a reward not the fulfillment of it that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.<br>
(2.1) Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.<br>C9: The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits<br>
(2.2) Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.<br>
If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive.<br>C10: How to Find and Fix The Cause of Your Bad Habits<br>
Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.<br>
(2.3) Create a motivation ritual by doing something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.<br>
(-2) Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive.<br><br>C11: Walk Slowly, But Never Backward<br>
Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition.<br>
The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning.<br>C12: The Law of Least Effort<br>
We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.<br>
(3.1) Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.<br>
(3.2) Prime your environment to make future actions easier.<br>C13: How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule<br>
(3.4) The Two-Minute Rule - When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.<br>
Decisive moments - choices that are like a fork in the road and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one.<br>
(3.3) Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.<br>
Standardize before you optimize. You cant improve a habit that doesnt exist.<br>C14: How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible<br>
A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.<br>
(3.5) Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases (to make habits easier and as commitment devices).<br>
(-3) Make it difficult. Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.<br><br>C15: The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change<br>
The first three laws of behavior change (make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy) increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time.<br>
The fourth law of behavior change make it satisfying increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time.<br>
(4.1) To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful even if its in a small way. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.<br>
(4.2) Make doing nothing enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.<br>C16: How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day<br>
(4.3) Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress.<br>
(4.4) Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.<br>C17: How an Accountability Partner Changes Everything<br>
(-4) A habit contract can be used to add a social cost to any behavior. It makes the costs of violating your promises public and painful.<br><br>C18: The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Dont)<br>
Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in unfavorable circumstances.<br>
Play a game that favors your strengths. If you cant find a game that favors you, create one.<br>
Genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on.<br>C19: The Goldilocks RuleHow to Stay Motivated in Life and Work<br>
The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.<br>
Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.<br>C20: The Downside of Creating Good Habits<br>
The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to little errors.<br>
Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery<br>
Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.]]></description><link>references\atomic-habits.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">References/Atomic Habits.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[James Clear]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2025 06:50:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Attention in learning]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Sparking idea:

<br>Visited Cape Spear to take 35mm film shots of the foggy area
<br>The foggy abyssal waters gave the guys gratitude for being on land
<br>The wet foggy look and existential feeling was reference/inspiration


<br>Foreground and lighting:

<br>Road texture with Quixel Megascans (experiment, dont settle with first option)
<br>Greyish green HDRI environment
<br>Area light to bring detail to ground
<br>DizzyViper's puddle maps to mix two textures like water and ground
<br>He strategically used two puddle maps to make strips of wet asphalt to add depth
<br>Filled scene with small detail assets from Megascans
<br>Forester for windy foliage in C4D


<br>The ocean:

<br>hot4D for C4D very customizable animated ocean
<br>Semi-reflective white foam material
<br>Scattering absorption shader for water
<br>Octane z-depth max to make fog in AE and save on render time


<br>Story:

<br>Placed car in foreground with the door open to imply owner in a rush

<br>Area lights or emergency lights and spotlight for headlights


<br>Small derelict boat floating on ocean midground
<br>Low poly oil rigs in background deep in fog


<br>Animation:

<br>GreyscaleGorilla's Signal plugin animates any keyframable param with loopable fluctuation
<br>Car forward and side axis linked to Signal subtly
<br>The car antenna is baked sweeped spline + dynamics + wind object
<br>Water animated by hot4D with total frames inputted to loop properly
<br>Boat constraint tag to clamp to duplicated reduced poly ocean surface to reduce motion rate
<br>Plants have fluctuating wind amount via Signal and different seeds to prevent clones

<br>Flowers inspired by different inspo photo, baked animation


<br>Two fog layers for rolling fog and headlight illumination:

<br>Octane fog volume with largescale high contrast c4d noise texture
<br>Layer and transform effects for animation




<br>After Effects composition:

<br>EXtractoR to apply Z-depth data
<br>feathered mask for manual occlusion in fog
<br>animated monochrome inverted high contrast fractal noise masked to puddles for windy rolling water low-opacity
<br>film grain to reduce clean CG vibe

Do what inspires thought and value daydreaming.<br><br>Take time out to just sit, fish for ideas and write them down with no filter.<br>
Characters pop into daydreams with all their details: speech style/speed, personality, etc.<br>
Read a script, manifest those feelings and detailed ideas as guides to direct a film.<br>
Films have many elements which all have to be really true to the idea to be greater than its parts.<br>
Put effort into getting a setup and establishing as a place to get your art done.<br>
"Every artist needs four guaranteed uninterrupted time of painting to get one hour of painting done."<br><br>Learn via doing, and get motivated via like-minded people.<br>
Sit in and do your work, translate your ideas into reality and don't take no for an answer.<br>
Learn a bit of film history; also film analysis by focusing in one category at a time.<br><br>You can tell if a character is right for casting just by how they talk, he might be fit for another.<br><br>Advise actors with the specific trait thats missing after rehearsal analysis.<br>
Begin with a "go wild" rehearsal and illustrate whats missing up to the perfect rehearsal.<br>
The character is somewhere within their minds, you just have to guide them there.<br>
Cut a few seconds after the logical end of scene.<br><br>Congradulate good work, create safe place so actors can go wild into a character without fear.]]></description><link>references\creativity-and-film.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">References/Creativity and film.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2025 11:29:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Focused home study]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>no programming exp: 1-2 tuts daily/2-3 months

<br>brackeys recommended


<br>1 hr game platformer 1lvl touch door = win

<br>open domain sound fx, game art, art, assets, etc.


<br>2 day still simple but content scaled according to prev like tds 2lvl
<br>end with 2 week scaled again then repeat 1hr 2day 2week loop

<br>this shows how much one is capable of completing
<br>also shows how to complete games (crucial)


<br>work on game design by making 8 games each under a week and 5lvl

<br>experiment: do smth weird, come up with ideas 

<br>hand-eye coordination?
<br>addicting number increase
<br>take existing concept with a gimmick:

<br>gravity switchign platformer
<br>knockback bullet fps




<br>first lvl tutorial, 4lvls increasing difficulty
<br>public domain art, sound fx, music again
<br>let friends play, see what they have trouble with and how to improve that

<br>should be the right amount of challenging
<br>use feedback to advantage




<br>take one of those ideas, make full length game with 100lvl

<br>intuitive iterative approach: play j starting area, feel like there should be a platform there, back to editor and add it, play again and feel like there should be a spike there, back to editor and add it, etc. (approach taken by doom level creator)
<br>refined random: toss a bunch of mechanics on a level then arrange it in a playable way, play, edit, play, etc., it works since the brain will try to solve the puzzle even if its not solvable yet and this may inspire a novel puzzle idea

<br>Caffeine occupies the adenosine receptors and compete with sunlight so delay caffeine by two hours
<br>Creativity is best between slightly energized to drowsy alertness
<br>Many people find peak alertness three hours after wake useful for calculation/linear tasks
<br>Go/no-go circuit: Basal ganglia and cortex (forebrain: rational thought) reciprocal communication and facilitates action via dopamine (D1 receptor) and suppresses action via D2
<br>Learning involves go and no-go: suppressing action is important
<br>Three levels of alertness (autonomic arousal) have biases for go, no-go and both

<br>Very high level of alertness biases towards go but less able to no-go

<br>Remove phone and disable internet to stop bias for stimulating distraction


<br>Sweet spot is where there's energy to go but not too much energy for no-go


<br>High-stress or very alert states benefit from silence and lower energy situations can benefit from background music
<br>Afternoon exercise prevents injury more but morning biases waking early and boosts morning alertness
<br>Andrew gets light on wakeup, delays coffee for two hours for 90min cognition-heavy learning period and balances too much energy by drinking salted water, generally gets exercise by first hour to three hours, meat salad nuts and fats for lunch instead of energy-draining hot foods, early afternoon low cognitive tasks, around 4pm hydrate non-sleep deep rest protocol then learning period more for 90min creative work
<br>Eating directs blood to gut lower alertness while fasting boosts
<br>Creativity has discovery mode for random abstract exploration via relaxed/sleepy mode and linear implementation mode for hard creations

<br>Some Asperger's and autism forms boost linear mode


<br>Perfume ad by Spike has noteworthy creativity
<br>Psychedelics unlock natural sensory suppression and can cause synesthesia, which alone isn't creativity like commonly assumed
<br>They allow lateral communication in the brain which can inspire novel ideas, which can be creativity but not necessarily as novel ideas must be reconfigured to be interesting, stimulating and/or delightful
<br>In most cases, they don't help with linear implementation
<br>They will probably be more helpful in clinical contexts for mental health help
<br>Morning light advances and evening light recesses circadian rhythm to help consistency
<br>10pm+ should be dimmed lights and no screens
<br>Evening meal is more carb-heavier (pasta, veges, etc.) with protein sometimes
<br>There's a peak of wakefulness an hour before bedtime useful for gathering resources in preparation for sleep which is normal
<br>It's normal to wake up briefly, look around and go back to sleep without remembering

 <br><br>
<br>The city's bullshit is portrayed well by the crowd navigation, color, spoken description, subway rumbling and sound design
<br>Sam commented that the noir (investigative vibe) was the notable part of this film
<br>The contrast between David's impatient hotshot behavior and William's calculated respectable behavior is best shown in the library/car reading scene almost comedically
<br>The twist at the end making David into Wrath and himself into Envy was shocking and well-executed, context being that I only knew Envy and some other sin was left

<br>Sam and I had no idea what the object in the box was


<br>David exposing William's true feelings at the bar was a brilliant twist on the characters
<br>Sam also enjoys how explicit the film's crimes were (I was desensitized entirely)
<br>SWAT scene's aesthetic was dark, gritty and exciting <img alt="SWAT" src="https://film-grab.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/34%20(906).jpg?bwg=1547383744" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br>The parkour chase was realistic and visually pleasing due to the rain and the Doe's all-black outfit <img alt="Parkour" src="https://film-grab.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/41%20(899).jpg?bwg=1547383744" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> <img alt="Dramatic" src="https://film-grab.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/42%20(897).jpg?bwg=1547383744" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"> <img alt="John Doe" src="https://film-grab.com/wp-content/uploads/photo-gallery/43%20(894).jpg?bwg=1547383744" referrerpolicy="no-referrer">
<br><br>Supplement: <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGcyTwBzN2s" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGcyTwBzN2s" target="_blank">What it all Meant</a><br>
<br>Opens with emphasizing opposing viewpoints between David/William

<br>William is detail-oriented
<br>David is arrogant, distracted, insecure


<br>David Mills is a "kid in an oversized suit" as he lazes around during the investigation

<br>He simplifies people down to good/bad and embraces apathy so he can live in the trashy conditions and is willing to raise a child
<br>Tracy, a grade school teacher which is all about helping children develop, is reluctant

<br>David and Tracy greet with childish insults then David leaves to show his dogs more affection


<br>His viewpoint isn't to be looked down upon, however, as its still very valid in context


<br>John Doe believes all people including himself are irredeemable sinners and enforces forced attrition

<br>His backstory is as vague as the movie's setting with no forced explanation, just unsorted journal entries and apartment (Aspirin and Bible in desk next to prayer beads and bullets, weapons stash)
<br>Instead of idling, he crafted a "performance" that would be remembered and expose sins that everyone was used to tolerating

<br>David and Tracy are forced to get used to the rumbling, to "tolerate" the BS
<br>This performance's setup is similar to how the writers set up David to be used by John's plan to be remembered by the viewer

<br>The case being given to David and the pair's relationship thereafter as well as John changing his plans at the end out of Envy for David's simpler life contributes to the film's memorability




<br>This ending wouldn't have been so incredible if it weren't for William Somerset

<br>William and John are a clear example of parallel characterization

<br>John's journaling and William's metronome help cope with environment
<br>Both are detail-oriented, very intelligent and hate idling
<br>Their similarity causes John's mentality to make sense

<br>He also insists that David's wrong in calling John insane as it's dismissive and can lead to fatal underestimation which is something John touches upon in the car when arguing with David




<br>William works after hours to crack the case while his coworker slack and is so invested in said work that at David's house, he asks for wine instead of beer and doesn't notice it's in a cup instead of wine glass (a childish decision by David) until he reflexively picks it up after feeling the onset of rumbling

<br>These actions are clear and reasonable unlike forcing someone to eat to death


<br>By framing using William, John seems much more plausible to exist in real life




<br>The film uses "procedural feel, characterization and costume design" to make it a full experience even without the memorable ending
<br>Uses of tropes at the start help make the film easier to consume and believe
<br>The crimes are made less and more shocking at the same time

<br>Less due to the familiarity due to the genre being pulp detective thriller
<br>More due to the exposure of the heroes' flaws

<br>In a similar film, Tracy would've survived and John killed for the viewers' cathartic release and satisfaction after David attempts to sway John one last time with a monologue
<br>Instead, this one spins the catharsis into a sin instead of the generic "we're more similar than you think; we both kill" and causes the villain to win




<br>The tone consists of violent rainfall almost always either visually or through noisy sound design

<br>Rain brings life but is usually used negatively in film
<br>The TV scenes, procedural writing and chase scene establish realism
<br>A place can't be shown to be immoral but rather shown via affect on characters
<br>The tone of citizen indifference and malice makes the sex toy murder believable
<br>Figuring out the murder via the crime scene afterwards builds mystery and realism

<br>It makes us imagine the capture method and John's methodical efficiency


<br>The sickening set design and lines like "You know this isn't gonna have a happy ending..." adds to the scope and tone of despair with extremely rare comedy


<br>Theme of apathy

<br>"I sympathize completely. Apathy is a solution. I mean, it is easier to lose yourself on drugs than cope with life. It's easier to steal what you want than it is to earn it."
<br>Doing the bare minimum is the easiest way to live without having to educate yourself or ponder other viewpoints

<br>To do better, one can start by doing something for the sake of someone else and/or for their own true satisfaction

<br>This is applied to non-profit organizations and entities like law enforcement
<br>It also applies to John but warped: William's comments about people's apathy set up Johns actions who decided forced attrition including himself was a better solution

<br>They made John a realistic, likeable foil and insisted-to-be-sane character who turned a stereotypical hero into a villain in a depraved setting to establish a sympathizable monster








<br>John Doe is the name of an unidentified man which suits his character as he does do crazy things but is understandable and still humane so considering that he is a person, he didn't change his plan for shock value at the end but rather because he genuinely wanted a simple/normal lifestyle

<br>His sin wasn't just envy but rather envy for the sin of sloth


<br>William decided to stay on the job since he no longer considered himself apathetic, most likely affected by David's exposure of him as well as the sins' conclusion

<br>"The world is a fine place and worth fighting for. I agree with the second part."


<br>Comments:

<br>"...7 deadly sins. Gluttony, greed, lust, pride, and sloth die. John Doe is envy. And by the end, Mills is wrath. 2 bodies in the desert. The angel of death, and his reaper." - hulkboyjr
<br>"The saddest part about the movie is the fact that John, SomerSet&amp;Mills all have the same goal, to restore justice in the world." - Raja Thyagaraj
<br>"the sound of the metronome in the rain is pretty symbolic of the movie's message, I'd say." - NoLikesToYear s

<br>DevOps is set of principles for relation between development and operations (deployment/management) w/ focus on:

<br>small/many deployment cycles
<br>product stability
<br>cross-team communication


<br>

<br>Manage flow of work


<br>Ensure work flows in one direction from dev -&gt; ops -&gt; player
<br>Eliminate waste: anything that doesn't provide value to player

<br>Motion: friction of info/material movement

<br>leads to Task Switching, Waiting
<br>fix: create self-service systems


<br>Task Switching: friction of excessive context changing

<br>leads to Defects, Waiting
<br>fix: work in small cycles


<br>Defects: issue making work/asset unusable downstream

<br>leads to Motion, Task Switching
<br>fix: test and find/fix problems at source


<br>Waiting: pause on delay

<br>leads to Task Switching, Unfinished Projects
<br>fix: deliver work in small cycles


<br>Unfinished Projects: delayed features made obsolete

<br>leads to Defects, Heroics
<br>fix: work in small MVP cycles


<br>Manual Processes: repetitive tasks done by hand

<br>leads to Task Switching, Defects, Motion, Heroics, Waiting
<br>fix: automation


<br>Extra Processes: unnecessary 

<br>leads to Task Switching, Defects, Motion, Heroics, Waitin
<br>fix: "Can we not?" eliminate if possible


<br>Extra Features: feature doesn't add to experience significantly

<br>leads to Defects
<br>fix: dont add/eliminate


<br>Heroics: working unreasonably long to rush dev

<br>leads to everything including itself
<br>fix: stop dev, observe/rebuild system




<br>Make work visible: tracking steps/work to seek waste

<br>Twice-weekly meetings on high-level goals, work allocation and trainee review
<br>Trello rules for employees and trainees:

<br>Inbox: new tasks here first to prevent Task-Switching
<br>To-Do: new tasks here for trainees
<br>Doing (Sprint): Constrain time demand to avoid Heroics
<br>Testing: review at source before sending downstream to reduce Defects

<br>Bottleneck 1: lowest production rate in chain which sets overall rate so only way to increase overall rate is to increase bottleneck capacity
<br>Testing reduces stronger link's rate but increases weaker link's rate


<br>Done 




<br>Deliver work in small cycles

<br>Bottleneck 2: Fix painful deployment by automating continuous builds for testing to reduce Manual Work, Task Switching and Defects

<br>automate locale for easy text/translations
<br>git commits (more deliberate since public now) -&gt; patch notes
<br>deploy updates seamlessly to all platforms and testers






<br>

<br>Amplify feedback loops


<br>Feedback flows in reverse direction from player -&gt; ops -&gt; dev
<br>Catches problems and improves processes
<br>Automate downstream feedback gathering

<br>Add to Trello widget converts submitted Issue details/attachments
<br>Add checkboxes to patch notes to automate QA checklists




<br>

<br>Continuously Learn


<br>Every teammate has the right to experiment and iterate on processes
<br>Psychological safety: risky ideas are carefully considered and encouraged
<br>Structures -&gt; worker circumstances -&gt; work culture
<br>Formalized quarterly reviews for high-level studio structural changes

<br>Teammates fill questionnaires about where their time/talent is wasted
<br>Studio waste analysis

 <br>Todo Chapters: Order, Logos, Breath, Voice, Ego, Control<br><br>
<br>The desire for acceptance is normal but one must keep the need for approval under control and be honest to ourselves instead of letting it influence our work too far
<br>Van Gogh didn't find acceptance for his work and kept to his methods though he ended up killing himself so we aren't "owed anything more than the struggles he endured"
<br>Talented artists end up deleting their social media accounts and writing rant blog posts because their skill didn't translate to online attention; we can avoid this by separating one's love of making art from the social media game
<br>Popularity doesn't indicate mastery, sometimes the opposite as usually only lower progress artists are impressed by a certain piece
<br>"The Internet is a million miles wide but often only an inch deep, so for me social media will never be my yardstick. Becoming an artist of any worth has to be a real-world pursuit and the work of a lifetime, so don’t let this empty chase distract you from that deeper work."
<br>Evaluate the individual purpose behind each social media account and use it accordingly.
<br>We should learn to derive pleasure from the process instead of the product when making art as this can lead to the greatest works from a unique voice, boost one's motivation and help find those true fans.
<br>"To make a living as a craftsperson, photographer, musician, designer, author, animator, app maker, entrepreneur, or inventor you need only thousands of true fans." - Kevin Kelly
<br><br>
<br>"Comparison is the thief of joy" - Theodore Roosevelt
<br>Envy can ruin enjoyment and bottleneck growth as an artist
<br>Recognizing surfacing envy is the first, most important step to using emotional intelligence and combating it like complimenting the other artist in question
<br>Giving a compliment counter-intuitively doesn't reduce the giver's greatness as an artist like the comparative thoughts may imply but rather raises them since it indicates generosity and thoughtfulness on top of the already respected skills
<br>Emotional intelligence can be strong in emotionally reserved or outward people
<br>A negative emotion usually means more about ourselves than the target
<br>Labelling or categorizing art is always belittling the work which indicates envy
<br>Ambition is great but treating an art form as a competition is unrealistic and emotionally harmful as we have access to billions of works through decades instantly via the internet
<br><br>
<br>A true artist can tell when the intention is showboating (to get positive responses) versus helping others (and speaking Truth)
<br>People are obsessed with their own opinions and some of them should be ignored, whether negative or positive
<br>A good artist worth listening to wouldn't be wasting time trolling with negative comments
<br>Absorbing uninformed positive comments would unbalance one's ego
<br>Criteria for accepting ongoing critique:

<br>Qualification:

<br>Artists quick to give advice that they don't follow themselves may just be frustrated at themselves or echoing other people and should be ignored
<br>Qualified critics sometimes don't partake in the art form themselves to prevent the perception of self-gassing or saltiness

<br>Martin Scorsese partakes and got backlash for denouncing Marvel
<br>Mark Kermode makes film review podcasts without having written one




<br>Intention: 

<br>Middle-management photographers may be very qualified to critique but care less about you and more about making themselves seem greater
<br>Sean agreed with his friend to be brutal but compassionate with one another and be 100% honest in their weekly discussions about their actions and events. They genuinely cared about one another so they didn't make any justifications and accepted the critique and never felt bad afterwards.
<br>"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another" (Proverbs 27:17)




<br>The three best "mirrors":

<br>Fellow artist friend working alongside you like Sean's friend

<br>The art genre doesn't have to line up


<br>A caring mentor like the one who was disappointed in Sean for showboating

<br>You have to provide some value for the valuable criticism in return
<br>Abstain from trying to steal hard-earned techniques and rather support your own voice like a good mentor would encourage


<br>One's self when mentoring someone else

<br>Assure the student that they'll need to be resilient to criticism but the intention will always be to improve their skills and out of compassion




<br><br>
<br>Ignoring the "win rate" for art and making small stepping stone works up to the winning photo are often keys to realizations that contribute to the winner
<br>Viewers can feel artwork that shows unadulterated self-awareness more deeply and open their inner wall to help deal with their own feelings better
<br>Emotions are indicative of direction to something more important internally
<br>"It matters not how strait the gate, How charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate: I am the captain of my soul." - Henley in Invictus

<br>He expressed his inner feelings while dealing with a leg amputation and bought comfort to Nelson Mandela in prison who read it to other prisoners


<br><br>
<br>Church leaders sometimes feel threatened by new ideas, questions, facts and science
<br>"Sean, I think you need to learn to grieve humanity"

<br>Even though the leaders were trying to sideline Sean, they were just trying to protect themselves from their own fears and faults
<br>People's most hurtful actions are mostly self-defense
<br>Sean realized he had deep-rooted low anger as well which, instead of being rude or lashing out, he can use to fuel his passion in speech and not worry about being judged for being emotional


<br>You can turn a "negative" quality into a positive by tweaking the method of expression
<br>When expressing those "negative" traits in your art with the positives, the product will be richer with Truth and less monotoned
<br>Along with our inner "shadows", the external hardships we endure can also enhance our work
<br>Mentally and emotionally skipping over these external shadows would prevent positive soul-forging similarly to how working out improves the body
<br>As difficult as it is to see it as so presently, we will be grateful for what a hardship provides our person one day
<br>Werner Herzog is one of Sean's favorite filmmakers as he includes dramatic voiceovers with a justified dark tone in content to better express Truth and the duality of human experience

<br>"We have to get acquainted with this idea that there is no harmony as we’ve conceived it. But when I say this, I say this full of admiration for the jungle. It is not that I hate it, I love it. I love it very much. But I love it against my better judgement."
<br>He lived through a war and extreme poverty so his honest and nuanced worldview is very interesting compared to the forced positivity of modern media


<br>The church propagates the idea that all humans were born with sin so everyone can become dependent on their services and we must internally reverse this

<br>Life is a spark of Order among Chaos and your particular spark is one of freak chance. We must embrace that light first to be able to share it in our art
<br>We focus too deeply on our flaws and forget the inherent beauty of ourselves


<br>"This idea of 'embracing my shadows' and 'protecting my highlights' has become a life philosophy for me."
<br>Negative ideas easily interrupt positive ones as an evolutionary survival instinct
<br>Hold present positive thoughts and moments in your head deliberately to mentally encode it as deeply as negative ones usually are
<br>Reveling in past and future thoughts will prevent the present positive ones from feeding and fueling us
<br><br>
<br>Sean was looking for the perfect meaningful but consistently-paying job that never came so he started doing meaningful work on his own time
<br>
<br>“The place God calls you to is the place where your deep gladness and the world’s deep hunger meet"
<br>The first part, deep gladness, is fulfilling passions that give us energy as we pursue it and that we're naturally drawn to, not necessarily because it's most dopaminergic

<br>Joseph Campbell deduced this "follow your bliss(/blisters)" by observing the patterns in his Hero's Journey to better understand human meaning in our own journeys
<br>Accepting ourselves as unique and following our natural inclinations from our combination of personality, nature, nurture and affinities would lead to our purpose
<br>Passions aren't necessarily art forms but also subjects/topics/themes of great interest


<br>The second part, world's deep hunger, is major issues in the world that need to be bought to light via art

<br>"Where Hunting Dogs Rest" by Martin Usborne is a photo project to show off the once-noble hunting dogs, galgos, in prideful stances inspired by old Velazquez dignified paintings of them but in terrible health set in their abandonment site to bring attention to the 100,000 aging ones that are abandoned, hung or even thrown down wells alive
<br>Sebastião Salgado travelled to "the former Soviet Union, shipwreckers in Bangladesh, firefighters in the oil fields of Kuwait after the Persian Gulf War, fishermen in Sicily, tea pickers in Rwanda, and most famously, gold miners in Brazil working in huge open pits" and for his Exodus project: "India, Vietnam, the Philip-pines, Ecuador, Palestine, Iraq, Yugoslavia, the Congo, and Rwanda" to bring attention to refugees
<br>Salgado and his wife, Lélia, contributed some proceeds to Instituto Terra, a national park they started by reforesting a small part of Brazil, their homeland, and serves as a demonstration for all future reforestation projects
<br>Tish Murtha bought attention to the Thatcher government killing off coal miner jobs and photographed children under hard living conditions with motherly genuine care
<br>Even if it isn't possible to convey such meanings in some art forms, proceeds can be donated to the right causes for these purposes and provide meaning to one's life


<br>"So much of art is communication, and we have to decide what we want to speak about."
<br><br>
<br>To withstand the tests of time, we must let go of the need to get things right the first time but rather adapt to circumstances and pursue new dreams if needed
<br>Finding a creative voice, one's bliss, the words to say, anything meaningful takes time
<br>"We stand more of a chance of making it to the destination and not giving up along the way if we learn to pack for the long road ahead."
<br>Carl Jung analogizes the two halves of the day with the phases of life
<br>First half, morning phase, is when one develops a healthy ego or sense of self

<br>We decide our job, politics, philosophy and our concept of the world with the goal of personal success or expression
<br>In the context of art, we decide style and skills to learn
<br>This phase can be frustrating as it takes lots of necessary failure and time
<br>Rushing the morning can lead to not being prepared for the afternoon


<br>The center point, noon, is the popular midlife crisis where we ask the real questions

<br>Is life pointed in the right direction? Are we becoming who we want to be?
<br>In the context of creativity, when noon hits and we realize our techniques, gear and style produced unexpected results
<br>We can sort the "good" from the "convenient" from the morning phase philosophies and gain the courage and flexibility to let go of what doesn't work
<br>We can't live our afternoons with the philosophies of the morning as everything we considered great and true in the morning become little and lies


<br>Second half, afternoon phase, is when one lets go of the ego

<br>Not everyone makes it here and those who do end up with the stoicism and calm controlled demeanor of the "village elder" or "sage" as they don't care to impress
<br>We eliminate the material and personality things that we got to project our best selves to the world and keep what really matters


<br>These phases don't work linearly and we cycle through them multiple times
<br>We need to enjoy and use each phase fully instead of rushing them as it's possible to make great deep art in either so just focus on making the best work possible
<br>A dead end is just a new beginning waiting for trick-less experimentation and search for meaning
<br>Be kinder to yourself about your progress as fluctuations and starts/stops are expected
<br>Things we make can gain meaning to people and ourselves as it ages

<br>Robin, a poor fletcher who's father was a great archer, is a terrible one. However, on his way to a Nottingham fare archery contest, he encounters a group of Norman soldier bullies and the leader challenges him to one where he wins by a stroke of luck. They attempt to kill him and he fires back and kills the leader. Knowing he will get hanged for the crime, he sprints without direction until his legs fail him and his two close childhood friends find him, Much and Marian, and they decide to risk their necks to help him against his will.
<br>After he sleeps in Much's barn for a night, Marion begins to lead a double life coming to see Robin and Much in the Sherwood forest where they try to hide from the King's foresters and the Sheriff's men while hunting the King's deer and sleeping in caves. Soon, many other poor but useful Saxon archers join Robin as he gained reputation as a legendary outlaw and everyone serves a role like helping with the fletching, hunting, guarding, making clothes, building shelter, etc. Little John, ironically a very large man, is the brawn who also mentors the young promising Cecil who's secretly a girl named Cecily. Will Scarlet is a former aristocrat and her brother. They also begin preying on rich aristocrat's carriages for money.
<br>Alan-a-dale request that the band help him rescue his woman, Marjorie, who's getting forcibly married to a Norman so they knock out all the guards at the wedding and Will's friend Friar Tuck performs the real ceremony. The couple join the outlaws as well as a lot of other families and women.
<br>Sir Richard of the Lea was kind to Robin when he was a King's forester but he's getting his castle taken since he spent all his money on bailing out his mischievous son who was sent to fight a war with the King. They arrive to the castle to pay off his debt with Marian and the Sheriff present, who's men are held at bow-point. Marian negotiates the deal so Robin doesn't get killed but the Sheriff is enraged by the humiliation so his hatred for the Outlaws is renewed and he ruthlessly seeks them from now on.
<br>The Sheriff holds an archery contest with a golden arrow as a prize intended to bait the legendary Robin of the Hood, now shortened as Robin Hood. He doesn't fall for it but sends Much and Cecily to see what happens. Much, disguised as a wrestler, meets the Green Man who offers him to join their troupe as a strongman but he declines. The winner of the contest looks strangely like Robin but turns out to be Marian in disguise trying to propagate the legend. Guy of Gisborne, a legendary mercenary hired by the Sheriff, assumes she is Robin Hood and cuts her into critical condition. Much and Cecily rush in to save her and the crowd enrages into a mob. Guy's men almost kill Much but Cecily kills the attacker with a dropped knife and gets PTSD from the encounter. The Green Man tells them to follow him and the four hide in the troupe's carriage. They travel to Friar Tuck's hideout where he tends to her wounds and Robin rushes there to admit his love for her and offers marriage after Much brings the news to Sherwood.
<br>After Marian is hidden underground, Guy of Gisborne track them to Tuck's hideout where the men kill one of his dogs and Robin's outlaws ambush them and miraculously win while being heavily outnumbered but not without losing many valuable comrades. Finally, Robin gets heavily injured but stabs Guy in the neck and kills him. Marjorie goes to request help from Sir Richard and he heads to Sherwood with horses to bring them to the castle and help them recover. He closes the gates and both he and the Sheriff contact King Richard the Lionheart about the situation. The band hopes he will favor their boldness and sympathy for the poor since the King, even though he's a Norman, has great character. Also, Cecily and Little John confess their love for each other.
<br>The Sheriff arrives at the gate a few days later while the band are still in recovery and suddenly, so does King Richard unannounced. They sit together and the King strips the Sheriff of his title and makes the outlaws swear fealty to the him. They then discuss their fates where the injured are offered to stay and take up a suitable profession while the able-bodied will be sent to fight for the war. Since Sir Richard's son died in the war, Robin will be his heir who will inherit the property when he returns and Richard dies. However, Marian and the injured band members all choose to join Robin in fighting for the war as they value their companionship more than anything else. The King accepts and allows Robin and Marian to get married before leaving to fight and the book ends with a toast to health, victory, the king's mercy and comrades.

<br>Zettel: One note per paraphrased/processed atomic idea with unique ID
<br>Linked to other older related notes by including ID in current
<br>
<br>Fluid structure

<br>top-down structured note system will start to fail with enough notes as contents can fit multiple categories
<br>down-up system with procedural, flexible and personally-tailored structure via maps of content with lots of links


<br>Interlinking

<br>designed to see connections between seemingly unrelated categories
<br>zettelkasten makes your notes system more than the sum of its parts


<br>Externalization

<br>write everything down: a nice thought, vaguely understood difficult concept, etc.
<br>trying to explain something reveals if understanding of concept is illusory
<br>can convert notes into book/paper draft without requiring huge effort at the end

<br>Luhmann took notes on slips of paper (zettels) stored in boxes (kasten) on ~18000 references
<br>Zettels were linked by analog hyperlinks so it was the first wiki
<br>Four phases:

<br>Reading and note-taking: took sparse notes on lots of media and discussion
<br>Rewriting: rewrote notes as zettel to fit respective topic's other zettels nightly
<br>Adding and structuring zettels:

<br>regularly review for ideas/questions/research prompts written as new zettel
<br>created hub notes of subtopics with 3-4 linked entry zettels
<br>top-level index hub note with terms of research interest as subtopics


<br>Asking questions: seeked answers by searching relevant keyword in index


<br>From these ideas, he compiled books and papers

<br>Three types of notes (each following type sources the previous type):

<br>Fleeting: ideas, quotes, book highlights, shower thoughts, etc.
<br>Literature: Processed concise summary of consumed media (break into parts for larger media like books) and own sparked thoughts from books
<br>Permanent: single atomic idea that's understandable without context


<br>Link two related notes via derivative insight note that links to both
<br>Insight notes are useful for content creation as unique topics to pursue
